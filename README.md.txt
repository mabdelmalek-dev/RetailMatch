A small Product Recommender that suggests similar items by analyzing product text (title, brand, features) with TF-IDF + cosine similarity, and exposes results through a tiny Flask API and web page. You can ask for “similar to tv_001” or “top in category TV,” and it returns clean JSON that the page renders as product cards.
